## How to run the application

You can create your own account or use a test account I set up by logging in with testing123@gmail.com, pw: 12345!

NOTE that the database is set up in testing mode (limited security features). There are no secrets or environment variables to set up.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Once you're in the project directory (`cd app`), you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
